 ## Introduction   
 **Disclaimer:** *this program is not for professional use. It has been written only for educational purpose, as an assignment project for the Network Management course at [Unipi](https://di.unipi.it/).*

This is a sniffer example using [libpcap](https://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/pcap.3pcap.html) to analyze the communication frequency of TCP streams.    
libpcap is a portable C/C++ library for network traffic capture. ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap))

**What does the jitter measure?** The jitter is defined as the *variation* in the delay (or latency) of received packets.

This program aims to see the jitter of TCP comunications happening from/to the host machine, and detects suspicious jitter variation. 
In this text we will try to cover and explain the essential components of this program and how it works in the following order:

 ## Project structure
This is a quite small project, but it's never a bad idea to give a general overview for a better file exploration.

## How to build it
In order to compile this project, you need to have [libpcap](https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap) (*v 1.9.1-3 or newer*) and [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) (*v 5.2 or newer*) installed.    
One way to easily get it, **on Ubuntu**, is to use the following commands:    
`sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`sudo apt-get install gnuplot`
`sudo apt-get install gnuplot-x11` 

### NB :
**This project must only be used in Ubuntu to avoid compatibility problems with the output terminal.**

To check your current version:    
`apt-cache show libpcap-dev` &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`gnuplot-V`
    
That's it! Now you can use the Makefile to get everything done, just run `make` in the project folder and you are ready to go.     

## Program usage
This program, once started, can capture packets *endlessly* or *stop once a default amount has been reached*. 
Those two ways to run can are determined by the value of the only parameter that this program accepts:

|NAME                |TYPE                       |OPTIONAL                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|packet_number|Non negative integer            |yes         |

**Examples**:    
Running `sudo ./bin/jitter 50` will stop after capturing the next 50 packets.    
If no **packet_number** is provided, so just running `sudo ./bin/jitter` will start sniffing non-stop.

**In both cases** it can be correctly stopped sending a **SIGINT** (*Ctlr + c*) interruption to this process.

Once that the sniffing has stopped, a very simple menu will show up to see the collected data.
